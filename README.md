# MovieList

## Overview

This is a simple application that shows a list of movies organized by
genre. This application uses the https://www.themoviedb.org/ api to
fetch the movie information.

This application is pretty much my playground to test new Android
libraries, architectural patterns, best practices, etc.

This application is not meant to be used as a guide to developers of
any kind, as to how your applications should be built.
