# MovieList

## Overview

This is a movie application that shows all movies from the MovieDb.
Based on genre, top movies, upcoming movies, and movies now playing. All
of the movie data is fetched from the https://www.themoviedb.org/ api.

This application is pretty much my playground to test new Android
libraries, architectural patterns, best practices, etc.
